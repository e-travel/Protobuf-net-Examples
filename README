protobuf-net Examples
=====================

What is this?
-------------
The protobug-net library doesn't come with documentation.

This is a set of examples that will show you the basics of the library.

How does this work?
-------------------
You can open the solution or each file. In order to run the examples NUnit is used. 

Of course there are some exmaples that "don't pass" as the lirary cannot do what is expressed in the example.
